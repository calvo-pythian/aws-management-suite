Enhanced sample settings file
------------------------------

I like to not put credentials in a source tree if I can avoid it.  I know you only have a sample settings file for this reason...so that the user has to copy that and therefore need not see it as a modified ogirinal source.  Still, these things tend to get checked in.  

What I prefer to do is put the settings in environment variables. That way, they're hidden away in the user's home directory, and any user can check out a set of sources and be ready to go if he is alreaqdy following conventions for settings up his credentials in his environment.

I kinda went nuts with this idea in the sample file.  See sample_settings.py file in pull request.

Suggestion for docs
--------------------

    Regarding settings file:  What are the SSH/SUDO settings for?
    
    Might want to mention that "pip install -r requirements.txt" must be run as root
    
    The docs should include the original GitHub url for the project.  I added that.

'cwd' independence
--------------------

The tool is not 'cwd' independent.  If you put ams in your path, as suggested, and then execute the command to set up the database while not int the ams directory, it doesn't work.  You get this:

	spindrift ~$ ams internals database install
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	  File "/Users/steve/bin/ams", line 110, in <module>
		main()
	  File "/Users/steve/bin/ams", line 106, in main
		args.func(args)
	  File "/Users/steve/bin/ams", line 34, in install_db
		sqlfile = open(filename, "r")
	IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/Users/steve/bin/schema/schema.sql'

A call to os.path.realpath() will fix this.  I went ahead and implemented this in the main 'ams' file. See the changes for that file in the pull request.
